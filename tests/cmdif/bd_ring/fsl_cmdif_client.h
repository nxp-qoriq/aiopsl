@Description	Command callback

User provides this function. Driver invokes it for all asynchronous commands
that had been sent through cidesc.

@Param[in]	async_ctx   User context that was setup during cmdif_open()
@Param[in]	err         Error as returned by server
@Param[in]	cmd_id      Id of command
@Param[in]	size        Size of the data.
		On the AIOP side use PRC_GET_SEGMENT_LENGTH() to determine the
		size of presented data.
@Param[in]	data        Data of the command.
		On the AIOP side it is the pointer to segment presentation
		address; use fdma_modify_default_segment_data() if needed.
		On GPP side it should be virtual address that belongs
		to current SW context.
@Return		OK on success; error code, otherwise.
@Cautions	Please make sure to modify only size bytes of the data.
		Automatic expansion of the buffer is not available.

		This function may be activated in synchronous and asynchronous

		Note, AIOP client supports only asynchronous commands see
		\ref CMDIF_ASYNC_CMD.

@Param[in]	cidesc     Command interface descriptor which was setup by
		cmdif_open().
@Param[in]	cmd_id     Id which represent command on the module that was
		registered on Server; Application may use bits 11-0.
		See \ref CMDIF_SEND_ATTRIBUTES.
@Param[in]	size       Size of the data including extra 16 bytes for 
		\ref cmdif_cb_t in case of \ref CMDIF_ASYNC_CMD.
@Param[in]	priority   High or low priority queue.
		See \ref CMDIF_SEND_ATTRIBUTES.
@Param[in]	data       Data of the command or buffer allocated by user which
		will be used inside command.
		This address should be accessible by Server and Client.
		It should be virtual address that belongs to current SW context.
		In case of asynchronous command last 16 bytes must be reserved 
		for cmdif usage.
		On GPP it must be from Write-Back Cacheable and 
		Outer Shareable memory. 		
@Param[in]	async_cb	Callback to be called on response of
		asynchronous command.
@Param[in]	async_ctx	Context to be received with asynchronous
		command response inside async_cb().

@Return		0 on success; error code, otherwise.
