User provides this function. Driver invokes it for all asynchronous commands

@Param[in]	cmd_id      Id of command
@Param[in]	size        Size of the data.
		On the AIOP side use PRC_GET_SEGMENT_LENGTH() to determine the
		size of presented data.
@Param[in]	data        Data of the command.
		On the AIOP side it is the pointer to segment presentation
		address; use fdma_modify_default_segment_data() if needed.
		On GPP side it should be virtual address that belongs
		to current SW context.
@Return		OK on success; error code, otherwise.

		outside CMDIF API, as an alternative each thread can open it's
		own session by calling cmdif_open().
		Only cidesc.regs must be set by user see struct cmdif_desc.

@Param[in]	instance_id	Instance id which will be passed to #open_cb_t
@Param[in]	data		8 bytes aligned buffer for internal use of the
		command interface.
		This address should be accessible by Server and Client.
		This buffer can be freed only after cmdif_close().
		On AIOP, set data as NULL. On GPP it must be from Write-Back 
		Cacheable and Outer Shareable memory.
@Param[in]	size		Size of the data buffer. If the size is not
		enough cmdif_open() will return -ENOMEM. On AIOP, set it to 0.
		By default, set it to #CMDIF_OPEN_SIZE bytes.

		Note, AIOP client supports only asynchronous commands see
		\ref CMDIF_ASYNC_CMD.

@Param[in]	cidesc     Command interface descriptor which was setup by

		See \ref CMDIF_SEND_ATTRIBUTES.
@Param[in]	size       Size of the data including extra 16 bytes for 
		\ref cmdif_cb_t in case of \ref CMDIF_ASYNC_CMD.
@Param[in]	priority   High or low priority queue.
		See \ref CMDIF_SEND_ATTRIBUTES.
@Param[in]	data       Data of the command or buffer allocated by user which
		will be used inside command.
		This address should be accessible by Server and Client.
		It should be virtual address that belongs to current SW context.
		In case of asynchronous command last 16 bytes must be reserved 
		for cmdif usage.
		On GPP it must be from Write-Back Cacheable and 
		Outer Shareable memory.

		command response inside async_cb().
