@Function	ipf_generate_frag

@Description	This function generates a single IP fragment and locates it in
		the default frame location in the workspace.

		Pre-condition - In the first iteration this function is called
		for a source packet, the source packet should be located
		at the default frame location in workspace.

		The remaining source frame is kept in the internal IPF
		structure, and remains open until fragmentation process is
		complete (\ref IPF_GEN_FRAG_STATUS_DONE).

		This function should be called repeatedly
		until the returned status indicates fragmentation is complete
		(\ref IPF_GEN_FRAG_STATUS_DONE).
		
		Ordering:
		For best performance it is recommended to work concurrently,
		and move to exclusive mode only before enqueuing the last
		fragment. From this point transition to concurrent is not
		allowed. This way fragments of different frames will be
		interleaved but ordering will be kept between the last
		fragments.
		Alternately, user can move to exclusive mode before calling IPF
		init or before enqueuing the first fragment. From this point
		transition to concurrent is not allowed. This way the whole
		fragmentation process will be done exclusively and there will be
		no interleaving between fragments of different frames. 
		However, in case there is IPSec later in the flow, the ordering
		scope must be Exclusive before first fragment enters IPSec.

@Param[in]	ipf_context_addr - Address to the IPF internal context. Must
		be initialized by ipf_context_init() prior to the first call.

@Return		Status. (\ref IPF_GENERATE_FRAG_STATUS or negative value on
		error.)

@Retval		-ENOSPC - Received packet cannot be stored due to buffer pool
		depletion. The default working frame is open and there is no
		frame remainder(since the fragmentation has not started).
		Recommendation is to discard the default working frame.
		The packet was not fragmented.
@Retval		-EIO - Received packet FD contain errors (FD.err != 0).
		The packet was not fragmented (unchanged).
@Retval		-ENOMEM - Buffer pool depletion was encountered during
		fragmentation process. Recommendation is to discard both the
		default working frame(current fragment) and the frame remainder
		inside the fragmentation context(what's left of the original
		frame).
		The packet was partially fragmented.

@Cautions	In the output fragment, ASA & PTA are not presented.\n
		No support in IPv6 jumbograms.\n
		It is assumed that the address of the presented segment is
		aligned to 16 bytes.\n
		It is assumed that the segment presentation offset
		is set to 0.\n
		Since during fragmentation process of an IPv6 frame, fragment
		extension (8 bytes) is added to the header, 8 bytes will be
		removed from the tail of the presented segment.

@Function	ipf_discard_frame_remainder

@Description	This function discards the remainder of the frame being
		fragmented in case the user decides to stop the fragmentation
		process before its completion (before
		\ref IPF_GEN_FRAG_STATUS_DONE status is returned).

@Param[in]	ipf_context_addr - Address to the IPF internal context.

@Return		Status of the operation (0 - Success).

@Cautions	Following this function no packet resides in the default frame
		location in the task defaults.
		This function should only be called after \ref
		IPF_GEN_FRAG_STATUS_IN_PROCESS status is returned from \ref
		ipf_generate_frag() function call.

@Function	ipf_context_init

@Description	This function initializes the IPF context structure that is

@Param[in]	flags - Please refer to \ref IPF_FLAGS.
@Param[in]	mtu - Maximum Transmit Unit.
		In case \ref IPF_RESTORE_ORIGINAL_FRAGMENTS flag is set, this
		parameter is ignored.
@Param[out]	ipf_context_addr - Address to the IPF internal context
		structure located in the workspace by the user.
		Internally used by IP Fragmentation functions.

@Return		None.
