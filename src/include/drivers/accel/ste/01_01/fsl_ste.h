@File		fsl_ste.h

@Description	This file contains the AIOP statistics API (01_01).

@Cautions	The counters that are updated by the STE must not be updated
		or initialized using any other means other than the STE API
		functions since the STE block is not synchronized with the 
		CDMA/FDMA/e200 cores hardware.\n
		All counters memory addresses should be aligned at minimum to
		their size. i.e. 4 byte counter should be 4 byte aligned and 8
		byte counter should be 8 byte aligned.
