 @Function      memcpy32

 @Description   Copies one memory buffer into another one in 4-byte chunks!
                Which should be more efficient than byte by byte.

                For large buffers (over 60 bytes) this function is about 4 times
                more efficient than the trivial memory copy. For short buffers
                it is reduced to the trivial copy and may be a bit worse.

 @Param[in]     pDst    - The address of the destination buffer.
 @Param[in]     pSrc    - The address of the source buffer.
 @Param[in]     size    - The number of bytes that will be copied from pSrc to pDst.

 @Return        pDst (the address of the destination buffer).

 @Cautions      There is no parameter or boundary checking! It is up to the user
                to supply non-null parameters as source & destination and size
                that actually fits into the destination buffer.

 @Function      memcpy64

 @Description   Copies one memory buffer into another one in 8-byte chunks!
                Which should be more efficient than byte by byte.

                For large buffers (over 60 bytes) this function is about 8 times
                more efficient than the trivial memory copy. For short buffers
                it is reduced to the trivial copy and may be a bit worse.

                Some testing suggests that MemCpy32() preforms better than
                MemCpy64() over small buffers. On average they break even at
                100 byte buffers. For buffers larger than that MemCpy64 is
                superior.

 @Param[in]     pDst    - The address of the destination buffer.
 @Param[in]     pSrc    - The address of the source buffer.
 @Param[in]     size    - The number of bytes that will be copied from pSrc to pDst.

 @Return        pDst (the address of the destination buffer).

 @Cautions      There is no parameter or boundary checking! It is up to the user
                to supply non null parameters as source & destination and size
                that actually fits into their buffer.

                Do not use under Linux.
