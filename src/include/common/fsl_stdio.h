@Function      fsl_print

@Description   Print formatted string with arguments received with it.
               The print function is limited to 1024 bytes of the formatted string length
               during the boot and 80 bytes during run time mode.
               This function has two modes of operation.  It automatically toggles
               between the two modes depending on whether the function is called
               during initialization or at run time.

               Initialization stage - During AIOP initialization the full formatting
               feature set is used, similar to printf from the C standard library.

               Run time stage - in this stage the AIOP uses a lite print and
               supports only a subset of the formatting features as follows:

               - %%c      - Prints a char.
               - %%d      - Prints an integer in decimal form
               - %%x      - Prints an integer in hexadecimal form
               - %%s      - Prints a string
               - %%l      - Prints unsigned 32 bit value.
               - %%ll     - Prints unsigned 64 bit value.
               - %%lx     - Prints a 32 bit value in hexadecimal form
               - %%llx    - Prints a 64 bit value in hexadecimal form

@note No support for special settings like %02x, etc at runtime.

@Param[in]     str - string to print.

@Return       none
