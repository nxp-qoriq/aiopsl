@Function      bman_fill_bpid

@Description   fill the HW pool with buffers.


@Param[in]     num_buffs         Number of buffers to fill in HW pool.
@Param[in]     buff_size         Size of buffers in pool.
@Param[in]     alignment         Requested alignment for data field (in bytes).
@Param[in]     mem_partition_id  Memory partition ID for buffer type.
				 AIOP: HW pool supports only PEB and DDR.
@Param[in]     bpid              Id of pool to fill with buffers.
@Param[in]     alignment_extension Used to shift first buffer if 8 bytes of HW
				metadata exist and make user field aligned.
				(Default 0 must be entered if not used for slab)


@Return        0       - on success,
               -EINVAL - slab module handle is null
               -ENOMEM - not enough memory for mem_partition_id
